   - Smaller file sizes, but quality degrades with each save

2. PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
   - Lossless compression
   - Supports transparency
   - Best for graphics, logos, and images with text

3. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
   - Lossless compression
   - Limited to 256 colors
   - Supports animation
   - Ideal for simple graphics and animations

4. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
   - Lossless compression
   - High quality, large file sizes
   - Commonly used in publishing and professional photography

5. WebP
   - Developed by Google
   - Supports both lossy and lossless compression
   - Smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and PNG
   - Growing support across web browsers

6. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

## Quality Preservation Across Formats

One of the biggest challenges when converting and splitting images across different formats is maintaining image quality. Each format has its own characteristics and compression methods, which can affect the final output. Here's how to ensure the best possible quality when working with various formats:

### Understanding Quality Loss

1. Lossy vs. Lossless Compression
   - Lossy compression (e.g., JPEG) discards some data to reduce file size
   - Lossless compression (e.g., PNG) preserves all original data

2. Generation Loss
   - Occurs when repeatedly saving an image in a lossy format
   - Can lead to visible artifacts and degradation over time

3. Color Depth Changes
   - Converting between formats with different color depths can result in color banding or loss of detail

### Best Practices for Quality Preservation

1. Work with High-Quality Source Files
   - Start with the highest quality original image possible
   - Avoid using already compressed or low-resolution images as sources

2. Use Appropriate Conversion Paths
   - Convert from higher quality to lower quality formats (e.g., TIFF to JPEG), not vice versa
   - Avoid multiple conversions between lossy formats

3. Optimize Compression Settings
   - For lossy formats like JPEG, find the right balance between file size and quality
   - Use the highest quality setting that meets your file size requirements

4. Preserve Metadata
   - Ensure important metadata (e.g., color profiles, EXIF data) is retained during conversion

5. Test and Compare
   - Always preview the converted image and compare it to the original
   - Use zoomed-in views to check for artifacts or loss of detail

### Format-Specific Quality Tips

| Format | Quality Preservation Tips                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| JPEG   | Use quality settings of 80-90% for optimal balance          |
| PNG    | Choose appropriate bit depth (8-bit vs. 24-bit)             |
| GIF    | Limit to images with few colors to avoid dithering          |
| TIFF   | Use lossless compression options like LZW                   |
| WebP   | Experiment with quality settings to find the best trade-off |

### Splitting and Quality

When splitting images, additional considerations come into play:

1. Resolution Awareness
   - Ensure split images maintain sufficient resolution for their intended use
   - Be mindful of minimum size requirements for platforms like social media

2. Edge Handling
   - Pay attention to how edges are handled during splitting
   - Some tools offer options for overlap or blending to maintain seamless transitions

3. Grid Consistency
   - When creating grids, ensure consistent quality across all split sections
   - Watch for compression artifacts that may be more noticeable in certain areas

4. Format Compatibility
   - Choose a format that supports the features needed in your split images (e.g., transparency for overlays)

### Quality Checklist

✅ Start with high-quality source images
✅ Choose appropriate conversion paths
✅ Optimize compression settings
✅ Preserve important metadata
✅ Test and compare before finalizing
✅ Consider format-specific best practices
✅ Ensure consistent quality across split sections

By following these guidelines, you can maintain the highest possible quality when converting and splitting images across different formats. Remember that the key is to find the right balance between quality and practical considerations like file size and compatibility.
